Hello! I made a rather basic version of hangman in python it it's actually kind of fun!
I'm still new to coding and python so it was definitly a challenge. A lot of debugging overcomplicated code.

To play, just run the code and choose a custom number of lives if you want (base is 7). 
Your guess can be a single letter in which case it will go into the guessed word so far if correct. You can also guess full words, but you have to get the full word to not lose a life if you do.
Have fun playing! let me know if something is wrong that I should fix.
